Talks and Presentations
=======================

We would love for all of our members to feel empowered to give a talk at one of our meetings!  If you have some ideas, let us know!  Everyone can bring something new to a topic, so don't think you have nothing to say (see this video: I Have Nothing to Say: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLdhamQlFfg&feature=youtu.be)  Below are a few resources and tips to help get you started.

Talk Formats:
-------------
Currently, two talk formats are available (although we are thinking of adding a third "medium-format" talk length):
* lightning talk - this is a short format talk, typically between 5-15 minutes
* full length talk - this talk is a full length talk, typically 60-90 minutes

Topic ideas and generation:
---------------------------
Stuck on a topic?  Try these ideas!
* Brainstorm! (I know, very cliche!)  But, REALLY brainstorm, don't censor yourself, and just get all those ideas out on paper!  Your best idea might be the one after you have gotten all the crazy/silly/dumb ones out of the way
* Pick a topic on something you want to learn about it, and learn while you write the talk (works best if you have some time on your hands)
* Or go with what you know, something you do all the time, and are quite knowledgable in
* Pick something on the fringe, which people may not know about
* Or pick something everyone is talking about, and speak at it from your angle
* Dispute something that people think is common knowledge
* Or discuss a best practice, why it may be a best practice now, and also why it maybe should not be a best practice
* Keep in mind, a talk is a starting place for a wider community discussion, so think about the things you would like to talk about with the community
* Make them THINK! (The audience, that is!)
* Or make them laugh :)

Writing/research:
-----------------
* Everyone has a unique angle on any topic, so you always have something to bring to a subject
* Speak to the middle; in other words, don't dumb down your subject to the lowest common denominator, but also don't talk over most of the audience's head
* Write an outline first (before slides), and keep your topic focused; all your points should support your main topic
* If any of your points are not directly supporting your main topic, cut them! This is like the acts in a play; they always support the conclusion of the play
* Try telling a story (beginning, middle, end), or give a process with steps (1, 2, 3)

Writing a proposal:
-------------------
When writing a proposal for a talk, here are some things to think about
* Keep the proposal brief, but engaging!
* Think about your audience
* Write more than one, if you have that option!  You never know which one may appeal to the reviewers
* Follow the rules for the call for proposal for the conference you want to speak at, and have someone proofread your submission
* Show, don't tell
* Be concise, to the point, and clear with your wording

Slides:
-------
* In order to support multiple ways that people learn, using slides, video, or music in your presentation can really help support your talk…
* …but, on the other hand, keep your slides light, fun and in a supporting role to your talk (we don't want to just read a list of bullet points)
* And also don't just read directly from your slides (at least not entirely!)
 * Keep your slides large and easy to read too
* Go ahead and add code snippets to your slides, but make sure the code is readable from a distance!
* Don't be afraid to cut, cut, cut from your presentation! (you are more likely to run over time than to fall short of your time!)
* Include speaker notes (and I did say notes! Don't write your whole talk, word for word, in your speaker notes)
* Include your contact information on a slide, so that people can contact you with questions  (info like email, Twitter, GitHub account, etc.)
* If you have a repo with code examples that support your topic, include a link in the slides for this also
* It is really great when you can share your slides with the group, so they can dive into the topic on their own later
* It's useful to have a slide (like an agenda) to lay out your topic at the beginning of your slides…
* …and a slide towards the end, to sum up what you have said

Preparation:
------------
* Practice (a lot!)
* Time your talk, and speak your talk when you do (when you talk out loud, it is slower than talking through your presentation in your head)
* And if it's too long, cut some more!
* Use your speaker notes to help remember important points or milestones in the presentation
* Speaker notes also can help get you back on track when you lose your place, or your lose your train of thought (it WILL happen)
* Don't be afraid to reinforce your main points by repeating them more then once (these are the points that you really want people to remember)
* Be prepared to answer surrounding questions (do some research around your topic also)
* Ask about the venue and equipment ahead of time, find out what you might need to bring with you (cables, presenter remote, speakers for your computer)
* Bring water!  You will want it!

Presenting:
-----------
* Arrive early at the venue, to iron out problems or issues with setup
* At the start of the talk, introduce yourself (it's common curtesy, right?)
* Be personable (smile, laugh if you want; we are all people here!)
* Keep in mind that your audience wants to hear what you have to say (they are not there to heckle you!)
* Don't be afraid to say you don't know something or don't have an answer to a question, but you can find out and follow up with an answer
* It's ok (and encouraged) to have meaningful pauses in your talk; this allows the audience to be better able to take in what you are saying (taking a drink of water is a good way to take a pause)
* Don't forget to breath!
* Also, keep in mind, you totally got this! ;)
